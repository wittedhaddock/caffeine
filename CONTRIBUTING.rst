Contributing
==============

This document covers how to get patches contributed back to caffeine.  For technical information about how to write them, see the `documentation <http://caffeine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html>`_.

Issue tracker
++++++++++++++

We use `GitHub <https://github.com/drewcrawford/caffeine/issues>`_.  

Generally, the issue tracker is a good way to get support.  If you have a problem, chances are soembody else has it too.

Familiarize yourself with `how to write a good bug report <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html>`_.

Patches
+++++++++

Submit a `pull request <https://github.com/drewcrawford/caffeine/pulls>`_.

Test coverage
+++++++++++++++

Your patch needs to pass all existing tests.  You can find out how to run them in the `documentation <http://caffeine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html>`_.

Adding test coverage with your patch increases the chance that it will be accepted, but is not strictly required.

Legal
++++++++

To get a patch merged, you need to clicksign our `CLA <http://www.clahub.com/agreements/drewcrawford/caffeine>`_.  If it helps, we've tried hard to have the least awful CLA that exists.
