caffeine is a backend-in-a-box that is designed for the applications of tomorrow.  Caffeine covers a lot of ground, but you can think of it as an alternative to BaaS_ offerings like like Parse_, StackMob_, Firebase_, and `iCloud Core Data`_, to web service schemes like XMLRPC_, Thrift_, and REST_, and to networking libraries like AFNetworking_.
