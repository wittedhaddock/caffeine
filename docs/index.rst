Welcome to the caffeine documentation!
=======================================

caffeine is a backend-in-a-box that is designed for the applications of tomorrow.  Caffeine covers a lot of ground, but you can think of it as an alternative to BaaS_ offerings like like Parse_, StackMob_, Firebase_, and `iCloud Core Data`_, to web service schemes like XMLRPC_, Thrift_, and REST_, and to networking libraries like AFNetworking_.  If you're interested in how caffeine is the same or different from these other services, read :doc:`what_caffeine_is_for`.

Development status
===================

caffeine is bleeding-edge, alpha-quality software, that will require getting your hands dirty.  Python3 (on the server) and iOS/ObjC (on the client) are the only supported platforms for the forseeable future.
