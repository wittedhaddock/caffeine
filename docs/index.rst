If you're interested in how caffeine is the same or different from these other services, read :doc:`what_caffeine_is_for`.

Development status
===================

caffeine is bleeding-edge, alpha-quality software, that will require getting your hands dirty.  Python3 (on the server) and iOS/ObjC (on the client) are the only supported platforms for the forseeable future.
